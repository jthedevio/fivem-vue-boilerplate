## Making changes

Once you are ready to make your own changes, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor (I like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
2. Add the changes you would like as per your needs.
3. If you want to test the changes in your local browser, type ``npm run dev`` and then open with your favorite browser the following URL ``http://127.0.0.1:5173/``
4. If you are ready to test the changes within your FiveM server then type ``npm run build``. This will compile the UI Web Application and place the compiled files under the ``dist`` folder.
   4.1 Connect to your server and type the command ``/nui-display``
